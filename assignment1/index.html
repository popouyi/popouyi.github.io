            1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
            with the experience?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The first thing I paid attention to was the unique 3D-like visual
            elements that were in the experience. The elements, along with the
            colour-scheme of the experience, really caught my eye and were
            pleasing to look at.

            2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each
            of your discrete actions.
          </h2>
          <p>
            There were multiple different actions that are in this experience :
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The Home page is responsive to the user's mouse movement, which
              moves the elements around.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are different visual environments that correspond to the
              different sections of the experience. When hovering over it, it
              responds by making the elements inside it float, and the user is
              taken to that section of the experience when clicking it.
            </li>
          </ul>

            3) What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
            with?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I was mostly engaged with the Omada section of the experience. The
            section features multiple different elements where users could
            interact with it like a game. There are 3 mini-games that the user
            can interact with to gain points, and the section also features a
            leaderboard that shows the top scorers.

            4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction
            with the experience?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The most common action that I did while interacting with the
            experience was mostly clicking on the different elements to check
            which ones were responsive. The experience is filled with
            interactions that are connected to the elements, which made me more
            intrigued to explore the experience further.

            5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
            interactive experience?
          </h2>
          <p>
            From my understanding, the primary goal of the experience is to
            introduce the company in general and to recruit new talent for the
            company.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="card">
          <h2>
            6) How does the interactive experience communicate this primary
            goal?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The different sections of the experience showcase the company's
            journey through its work, values, and company culture. The visual
            elements also help visualise the topic that the section is
            highlighting.

            7) What is your impression of how the experience should be
            interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different
            times)
          </h2>
          <p>
            This experience feels like its something that users could come back
            to once in a while. For the first time, the user might need some
            more time to explore the experience and the company’s project. The
            experience is not built for long-term visits and after the first
            visit, the user might visit again to view the company’s portfolio or
            events.

            8) How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
            interacted with over time?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The experience has a simple and easy-to-navigate content structure
            that lets the user scroll at their own pace. The experience doesn’t
            overwhelm, it has clear points and sections, so that the user is
            encouraged to come back when there are new updates or content.

            9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
            reference?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The experience references physical experiences in the luni-life
            section. It introduces physical events, podcasts, seminars,
            merchandise, and their social media platforms.

          </h2>
          <p>
            The references encourage the users to follow the company’s updates
            and events.

          <p>
            The references makes us feel more connected and inspired to know
            more about the company.

            12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
            what makes that part frustrating?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The frustrating part is that sometimes we don’t know what to click
            or explore, and the lack of a preview, which makes us look into it
            deeper.

            what makes that part satisfying?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The most satisfying part are the small interactions with the visual
            elements, and the responsive nature of the website. The soft and
            vibrant colours of the experience further enhance these features.
